			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hi!</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my personal website.</p>
			<p>
				Here I'll try to document my journey as an entrepreneur, a thinker and a
				teacher. I have tried many times to maintain a personal website but to
				no avail. I tried Squarespace and Substack but I ditched both after a
				few days.
			</p>
			<p>Shame.</p>
			<p>Well!</p>
			<p>
				Here goes nothing as I ostentatiously code a whole website from scratch.
				Site builders and managed CMS are for losers (jk I suck).
			</p>
			<p>
				I will be berating myself in the entirety of this coded up mess. But as
				I do that, I hope you find something you can take in your life and use.
